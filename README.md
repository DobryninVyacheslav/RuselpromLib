<h1 align="center">RuselpromLib</h1>

# Description
RuselpromLib is a simple, higher-level set of functions based on the Java API for Creo Parametric. The library is designed to easily interact with Creo Parametric using Java and consists of classes that implement the basic logic needed to develop auxiliary applications for Creo Parametric.
At this stage, this library does not use such generally accepted principles as SOLID, so it is simple and not very extensible.
